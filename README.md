### Knight Travails

**Knight travails** is a library that computes how many moves a knight would take from one arbitrary square to another at a minimum on the chessboard. It constructs an unweighted graph of all the chess squares connected by knight movements and find the shortest path with modified [dijkstra alogrithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm).
